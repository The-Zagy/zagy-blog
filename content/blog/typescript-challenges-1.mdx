In the TypeScript Challenges series, I explore various challenges from the [ts-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) repository on GitHub.
Each article focuses on a specific challenge and provides an explanation of the solution.
Today's challenge is the [Cartesian Product](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/main/questions/27862-medium-cartesianproduct/README.md) challenge.
I encourage you to attempt the challenge yourself before proceeding with the explanation.

# Problem description

Given 2 sets (unions), return its Cartesian product in a set of tuples, e.g.

Ex:

```ts
CartesianProduct<1 | 2, "a" | "b">;
// [1, 'a'] | [2, 'a'] | [1, 'b'] | [2, 'b']
```

So basically take every item from first union with every item from the second union, pretty straight forward.

---

# Solution

```ts twoslash
type CartesianProduct<T, U> = T extends T
    ? U extends U
        ? [T, U]
        : never
    : never;
```

The solution is sourced from this [issue](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/issues/28095).
However, to fully understand the solution, there is one crucial piece of knowledge that is not explicitly explained.

Lets dissect the solution piece and by piece and explain what that piece of knowledge is along the way,
first look at this `CartesianProduct` type. You can see that it takes a generic that takes `T`,and does a conditional type check but WTF does that `T extends T` and `U extends U` do?
Well that's **_distributive conditional types_** at play.

## Distributive Conditional Types

According to the documentation

    In instantiations of a distributive conditional type T extends U ? X : Y,
    references to T within the conditional type are resolved to individual
    constituents of the union type (i.e. T refers to the individual constituents
    after the conditional type is distributed over the union type).
</Quote>

That's definietly a mouthful but it's actually saying something very simple, that to evaluate `F<A | B>`, you should evaluate `F<A> | F<B>`. In other words you can
say that every member of the union is **distributed** that a T represent an individual member at a time. so basically when ever you pass a union to a generic, you can imagine
that every member of that union will be evaluated individually and the results will finally be unionized.

I'll take an example from [Matt Pocock's workshop repo](https://github.com/total-typescript/type-transformations-workshop/blob/main/src/04-conditional-types-and-infer/28-distributive-conditional-types.problem.ts) that will use this concept to solve a problem.

```ts twoslash
type Expect<T extends true> = T;

type Equal<X, Y> = (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends <T>() => T extends Y
    ? 1
    : 2
    ? true
    : false;

// ---cut---
// @errors: 2344
type Fruit = "apple" | "banana" | "orange";

type AppleOrBanana = Fruit extends "apple" | "banana" ? Fruit : never;

type tests = [Expect<Equal<AppleOrBanana, "apple" | "banana">>];
```

Let's examine the example, first to to clear up any confusion, `Expect` and `Equal<T1,T2>` are just utility types to test T1 is T2.In this case, we expect `AppleOrBanana`
to be `apple|banana`. However, as you can see, that's not the case here. If you hover over `AppleOrBanana` you'll discover that it's actually of type `never`.  
The reasoning behind this is actually straight forward type `Fruit` is a superset of `"apple"|"banana"` so the conditional `extends` falls into the second branch, the `never` branch
,if you want more details about you can check this article [here](https://www.zagy.tech/blog/post/typescript-extends-is-weird).
Now, the question is,
how can we achieve the desired behavior of extracting `"apple"|"banana"` from the type `Fruit`?
The answer lies in the concept of **Distributive Conditional Types** Let's explore this further by looking at the code below.

```ts twoslash
type Expect<T extends true> = T;

type Equal<X, Y> = (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends <T>() => T extends Y
    ? 1
    : 2
    ? true
    : false;

// ---cut---
type Fruit = "apple" | "banana" | "orange";

type GetAppleOrBanana<T> = T extends "apple" | "banana" ? T : never;

type AppleOrBanana = GetAppleOrBanana<Fruit>;

type tests = [Expect<Equal<AppleOrBanana, "apple" | "banana">>];
```

Now you might be wondering, why does this approach work? We haven't made significant changes;
we're just passing the type Fruit as a parameter to this generic type.
This shouldn't make a difference compared to directly using it like `type AppleOrBanana = Fruit extends "apple" | "banana" ? Fruit : never;`, right?

I completely understand your confusion,
as it also puzzled me the first time I encountered this. Let's explore how distributive conditional types solve this problem.

As mentioned earlier, `T<A|B>` is evaluated as `T<A> | T<B>`. Let's substitute the parameters into our type and see how it evaluates:

`GetAppleOrBanana<Fruit> = GetAppleOrBanana<"apple" | "banana" | "orange"> = GetAppleOrBanana<"apple"> | GetAppleOrBanana<"banana"> | GetAppleOrBanana<"orange">`

By applying the distributive conditional types, we are effectively generating separate branches for each member of the union type.
This allows us to capture and process each possible value individually.
Consequently, we obtain the desired result by expanding the type based on the elements within the union.

```ts twoslash
type Expect<T extends true> = T;

type Equal<X, Y> = (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends <T>() => T extends Y
    ? 1
    : 2
    ? true
    : false;

// ---cut---
type Fruit = "apple" | "banana" | "orange";

type GetAppleOrBanana<T> = T extends "apple" | "banana" ? T : never;
type Apple = GetAppleOrBanana<"apple">;
type Banana = GetAppleOrBanana<"banana">;
type Orange_NEVER = GetAppleOrBanana<"orange">;
type AppleOrBanana = Apple | Banana | Orange_NEVER;
type AppleOrBananaWithTheUnion = GetAppleOrBanana<"apple" | "banana">;

type tests = [
    Expect<Equal<AppleOrBanana, "apple" | "banana">>,
    Expect<Equal<AppleOrBanana, AppleOrBananaWithTheUnion>>,
];
```

Now, let's revisit our initial problem and examine a simplified version of the answer. The Union type we encounter takes a union type as input and returns each member of the union as a tuple containing only itself. With our understanding of distributive conditional types, the purpose of this type becomes apparent.
The comment says it all: `// Union<2 | 3> -> [2] | [3].`

```ts twoslash
// Union<2 | 3> -> [2] | [3]
type Union<T> = T extends T ? [T] : never;
```

The solution to the problem actually takes this a level further, lets plug in the parameters into the type to make sure that we fully understand what it does.

```ts
type CartesianProduct<T, U> = T extends T
    ? U extends U
        ? [T, U]
        : never
    : never;
```

Let `T=1|2` and `U = "a"|"B"` the type actually evaluates to

```ts twoslash
type CartesianProduct<T, U> = T extends T
    ? U extends U
        ? [T, U]
        : never
    : never;

type Expect<T extends true> = T;

type Equal<X, Y> = (<T>() => T extends X ? 1 : 2) extends <T>() => T extends Y
    ? 1
    : 2
    ? true
    : false;
// ---cut---
type T1 = CartesianProduct<1, "a">;
type T2 = CartesianProduct<2, "a">;
type T3 = CartesianProduct<1, "b">;
type T4 = CartesianProduct<2, "b">;
type Result = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4;
type ResultWithUnions = CartesianProduct<1 | 2, "a" | "b">;

type tests = [
    Expect<Equal<Result, [1, "a"] | [2, "a"] | [1, "b"] | [2, "b"]>>,
    Expect<Equal<Result, ResultWithUnions>>,
];
```

# Conclusion

Distributive Conditional Types might seem like a foriegn concept at first but I hope this article made things a tad bit clearer for you.

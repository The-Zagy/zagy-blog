Typescript's `extends` is quite unique, it's set theory inspried and can get tricky to think about at time,
in this article I'll give you some interactive examples that by the end of it you'll have a firm understanding of what extends
means

### The easy extends part

You probably know that if I say for example
```ts twoslash
interface Weapon {
  damage:number
}
interface SharpWeapon extends Weapon {
  bleedDamage:number
}
let sword:SharpWeapon = {damage:1,bleedDamage:5};
```
that means that SharpWeapon is `{damage:number, bleedDamage:number}`, you know standard inheritance stuff.

Now with that out of the way lets discuss the more difficult part of extends

### The more difficult extends part

Back in primary school you if A = {1,2} and B = {1,2,3,4} than means that A ⊂ B meaning that A is a `subset` of B or A fits in B
Now types in typescript is similar, if A extends B that means that A ⊂ B or A fits in B or in other words 
<Callout type="note">
A extends B means that every value that can works for the type A can work for the type B
</Callout>
but please note that this is not a two-way relationship 
<Callout type="con">
If A extends B, values of type B can often not "fit in" in type A, in fact they can only fit if and only if A = B
</Callout>

some people like to think of A extends B as A ≤ B but careful thinking about it this way because it can be tricky to think about it
this way when thinking of objects or interfaces to be *specific*

Now to solidifiy the idea lets take some examples, I've borrowed these examples from [Mike North's](https://github.com/mike-north)
[Awesome Typescript course](https://www.typescript-training.com/course/intermediate-v1)
Think about these carefully, when you're finished the answer is below these
Btw the ternary operator you see in the example is something called conditional types
```ts
type answer_1 = 64 extends number ? true : false

type answer_2 = number extends 64 ? true : false

type answer_3 = string[] extends any ? true : false

type answer_4 = string[] extends any[] ? true : false

type answer_5 = never extends any ? true : false

type answer_6 = any extends any ? true : false

type answer_7 = Date extends { new (...args: any[]): any }
  ?  true
  : false

type answer_8 = typeof Date extends { new (...args: any[]): any }
  ?  true
  : false
```

Answer: 
```ts twoslash
type answer_1 = 64 extends number ? true : false
//     ^?
type answer_2 = number extends 64 ? true : false
//     ^?
type answer_3 = string[] extends any ? true : false
//     ^?
type answer_4 = string[] extends any[] ? true : false
//     ^?
type answer_5 = never extends any ? true : false
//     ^?
type answer_6 = any extends any ? true : false
//     ^?
// prettier-ignore
type answer_7 = Date extends { new (...args: any[]): any }
//     ^?
  ?  true
  : false
// prettier-ignore
type answer_8 = typeof Date extends { new (...args: any[]): any }
//     ^?
  ?  true
  : false
```

Now to explain those answers, I want to you to think with me and ask the following questions
can the type on the left fit in the type on the right or in other word is the type of the right more general than the type on the left?
Ok first
1. `64 extends number`, true because the set containing 64 can fit inside the set of all number, in other words 64 is a "more *specific* version of number" 
2. `number extends 64`, false because the set of all numbers cannot possible belong to the set containing the number 64, in other words number is a more general version of 64
3. `string[] extends any`, true because the set of all the possible combination of string arrays can fit in the set of any possible value, in fact anything can fit into any because it literally means the set of any possible value
4. `string[] extends any[]`, true because the set of all the possible combination of string arrays can fit into the set of any possible array, the "any possible array" here is a more general from of string array
5. `never extends any`, true because an an empty set is a subset of any other subset
6. `any extends any`, true because if you remember extends can also mean that the left operand = right operand



Now before we discuss these last two examples, I want to talk about extending in object or interfaces;


People tend to get confused in this part because it's not necessarily intuitive, remember our first example 
```ts twoslash
interface Weapon {
  damage:number
}
interface SharpWeapon extends Weapon {
  bleedDamage:number
}
let sword:SharpWeapon = {damage:1,bleedDamage:5};
```
here SharpWeapon is a more *specific* version of Weapon, because we've put another constraint for the user of the interface
when we added `bleedDamage` so logically speaking every SharpWeapon is a Weapon but not every Weapon is a SharpWeapon
just like extends taught us that the operand on the left must fit in the operand on the right, now remember when I told you
that some people like to think of A extends B as A ≤ B and not to think that way? it's time to tell you why

when I added bleedDamage to the SharpWeapon interface I've made the interface "bigger" it has to carry two values now
the damage value and the bleedDamage value now if you think SharpWeapon extends Weapon? you'd say no SharpWeapon is "bigger" than Weapon

Now you get the idea why it's gravely wrong to think about it this way, think about it instead by which is more specific and which is more general
or which has more strict constraints and which has looser constraints

returning to our examples:

7. `Date extends { new (...args: any[]): any }`, false because Date here is the type of the instance not type of the class itself
8. `typeof Date extends { new (...args: any[]): any }`, now after adding typeof we're not talking about the class itself, so we're asking the question is the class a newable? does the class at least have a call to new on it? and the answer is absolutely yes

### Conclusion
`Extends` can indeed be tricky but I hope the framework I gave you in this article can make things a bit easeir for you,
just think about which type is more `specific` and which type is more `general` and don't get confused when dealing with interfaces

Like every web developer out there, we made our own personalized blog to write about tech. and here's your standard how I wrote this
blog post, also you can find the code to the entire blog [here](https://github.com/The-Zagy/zagy-blog)



### My first thoughts
I found the idea of type safety across the backend and the frontend fascinating that's why I went with [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/).
I don't have much client side fetching so I didn't really make use of trpc that much but it was still nice to have
My first thought was to create an admin dashboard to manage, edit and create blog posts. this dashboard would contain some kind of WYSIWYG editor,
but I soon changed my mind when I first knew about MDX.
<Quote author="MDXjs website" href="https://mdxjs.com/">
  MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components,
   such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.
    This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. 🚀
</Quote>
in fact, the quoted message you've just seen is only possible thanks to MDX.
I also really liked the idea of leeching onto Github and using it as a CMS, and thus the idea of developing my dashboard died,
also this came with lots of benefits like:
- Other people can suggest edits or fix typos if they want.
- Having version control over the content.
- The weird flex of having Github as your CMS.

This also came with the problem of syncing the content of Github with the content on the blog.
  
### Tech stack

As mentioned we used Create T3 App which comes setup with:
  
- Prisma: This is an ORM that works very well with typescript
- Nextjs: You know what Nextjs is
- Tailwind: Got to say after using Tailwind there's no coming back to vanilla CSS or even any flavor of preprocessed CSS
- NextAuth: We never actually used this because all the procedures in the blog are public, but it's nice to have if we wanted to add
 anything that requires creating an account in the future
- TRPC: Some typescript fuckery that makes sharing types around your app a piece of cake.

<Callout type="note">
  We've also come to add Turborepo, `pnpm` and `express` to make a `monorepo` check 
 [Why monorepo](#why-monorepo)
</Callout>
Less crucial stuff but deserves a mention nonetheless:
- Octakit: makes communicating with Github's API as easy as calling a function
- Giscus: a cool package to continue leeching on Github, it maps a Github discussion thread to URLs in your site, and makes
an iframe to let you see those comments on your website, effectively "adding" comments to your website 
- NextThemes and NextSeo: Makes managing those two that much easier
### The process
The process of the whole blog is fairly simple, there is an express server actively listening for changes on the /blog/content on github
express server gets notified through a workflow and begins parsing the newly added `mdx` files.
Through [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) and some other plugins in the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com) ecosystem
those plugins allow you to added customized parsing to your markdown content, for example the youtube embed below was just a normal link
but through plugins it transfroms into an embed, you can also bulid your own plugins it's relatively easy to get started

the metadata gets extracted like the post title, description and slug, also the .mdx file gets converted to a string of code, react code to specific and then `express` stores these information
in the database and notifies nextjs server that new content with the extracted slugs exists so it can revalidate those pages if the exist.   

### Behind the scenes
  First when any post changes in any way names of the files changed get sent to the express server, through Github actions

  ```yml {8} showLineNumbers
- name: Send a request to revalidate those files
 if: steps.files.outputs.any_modified == 'true'
 uses: fjogeleit/http-request-action@v1
 with:
   url: "${{secrets.REVALIDATOR_URL}}"
   method: "POST"
   customHeaders: '{"Content-Type": "application/json","Authorization":"${{secrets.SEED_PASS}}"}'
   data: '{"added":"${{steps.files.outputs.added_files}}", "deleted": "${{steps.files.outputs.deleted_files}}", "modified": "${{steps.files.outputs.modified_files}}", "renamed": "${{steps.files.outputs.renamed_files}}"}'
   timeout: 1200000
  ```
then the express server updates the database with the new information and then calls the Next app to inform of the new information
```ts showLineNumbers
//in express
await axios.post(url + 'api/revalidate/', {id},
 {
    headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'Authorization': process.env.SECRET,
    }
});
```
and finally the Next app receives the request and updates the visible content to the user

```ts showLineNumbers
//in next /api/revalidate
if (req.body && req.body.filePath) await res.revalidate(req.body.id);
else throw new Error("Body wasn't provided with correct data");
res.end();
```

### The syncing problem
When it boils down to it, the app consists of 2 pieces:
- The actual Nextjs application 
- The revalidator that updates the content on the database to keep in sync with the content on Github
and then informs the Nextjs application through a call to /api/revalidate with the page url to update

Now a good question would be why do you need the express server? couldn't you do the work the server does in Next's /api/revalidate route?
The answer to those two questions is yes and no:
Yes I can do that on the next app but there's a problem, I'm on the free plan on Vercel which means that any request has a timeout
of 10 seconds only, if you exceed those 10 seconds in any request you'll be greeted with this message with your request failing:

<Quote author="Vercel on free tier">
  Task timed out after 10.01 seconds 😭😭😭
</Quote>

so me being a currently broke unemployed student, I had to find a workaround, the workaround was to create a web server to do the heavy
working for me and only call nextjs when I absolutely need to, in this case when asking it to revalidate the page using
`res.revalidate(url)` which is called [On-demand revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation)
thus utilizing the incremental static regeneration feature of Nextjs and not needing to rebuild the entire Nextjs app whenever some content changes 
I deployed the web server on Heroku using the 156$ credits given to me by [Github](https://education.github.com/pack)

### Why monorepo
Because Express and Next share the same database schema and some utilities, I wanted to keep things as DRY as I can.
Also, this will make things easier for me if I wanted to extend the blog in the future, make a react native app for example.
I first tried using NX which was a pain in the ass to use, also the documentation was unhelpful in my opinion.
then I tried Turborepo and everything worked like a piece of cake. you can follow [this](https://www.jumr.dev/blog/t3-turbo) guide if you want to transform an app
created with create-t3-app to a monorepo with turbo repo.

### Why do you need a database
Because Github times you out if you make too many requests, and also because I wanted to make more complicated queries on posts
and tags but who knows maybe I will find a better approach in the future.

### Concolusion
If you want a build a portofolio blog definietly consider using MDX
